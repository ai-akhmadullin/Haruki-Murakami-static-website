            <section id="description">
            <p>An intimate look at writing, running, and the incredible way they intersect, from the incomparable, 
                bestselling author Haruki Murakami.</p>
            <p>While simply training for New York City Marathon would be enough for most people, Haruki Murakamiâ€™s 
                decided to write about it as well. The result is a beautiful memoir about his intertwined obsessions with 
                running and writing, full of vivid memories and insights, including the eureka moment when he decided to 
                become a writer. By turns funny and sobering, playful and philosophical, <em>What I Talk About When I Talk 
                    About Running</em> is rich and revelatory, both for fans of this masterful yet guardedly private writer 
                    and for the exploding population of athletes who find similar satisfaction in athletic pursuit.</p>
