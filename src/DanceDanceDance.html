            <section id="description">
            <p>In this propulsive novel, one of the most idiosyncratically brilliant writers at work in any language fuses 
                science fiction, the hard-boiled thriller, and white-hot satire into a new element of the literary periodic 
                table.</p>
            <p>As he searches for a mysteriously vanished girlfriend, Haruki Murakamiâ€™s protagonist plunges into a wind 
                tunnel of sexual violence and metaphysical dread in which he collides with call girls; plays chaperone 
                to a lovely teenaged psychic; and receives cryptic instructions from a shabby but oracular Sheep Man. 
                <em>Dance Dance Dance</em> is a tense, poignant, and often hilarious ride through the cultural Cuisinart 
                that is contemporary Japan, a place where everything that is not up for sale is up for grabs.</p>
