            <p>The year is 1984 and the city is Tokyo.</p>
            <p>A young woman named Aomame follows a taxi driver’s enigmatic suggestion and begins to notice puzzling 
                discrepancies in the world around her. She has entered, she realizes, a parallel existence, which she 
                calls 1Q84 “Q is for ‘question mark.’ A world that bears a question.” Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named 
                Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author 
                that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled.</p>
