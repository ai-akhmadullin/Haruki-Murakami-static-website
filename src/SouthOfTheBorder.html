            <section id="description">
            <p>Born in 1951 in an affluent Tokyo suburb, Hajime—beginning in Japanese—has arrived at middle age wanting 
                for almost nothing. The postwar years have brought him a fine marriage, two daughters, and an enviable career 
                as the proprietor of two jazz clubs. Yet a nagging sense of inauthenticity about his success threatens 
                Hajime’s happiness. And a boyhood memory of a wise, lonely girl named Shimamoto clouds his heart.</p>
            <p>In <em>South of the Border, West of the Sun</em>, the simple arc of a man’s life—with its attendant rhythms of 
                success and disappointment—becomes the exquisite literary terrain of Haruki Murakami’s most haunting work. 
                When Shimamoto shows up one rainy night, now a breathtaking beauty with a secret from which she is unable 
                to escape, the fault lines of doubt in Hajime’s quotidian existence begin to give way. And the details of 
                stolen moments past and present—a Nat King Cole melody, a face pressed against a window, a handful of ashes 
                drifting downriver to the sea—threaten to undo him completely. Rich, mysterious, quietly dazzling, <em>South of 
                the Border, West of the Sun</em> is Haruki Murakami’s wisest and most compelling work.</p>
