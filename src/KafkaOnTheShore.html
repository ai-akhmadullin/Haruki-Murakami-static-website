            <section id="description">
            <p><em>Kafka on the Shore</em> is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away 
                from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; 
                and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward 
                Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom.</p>
            <p>As their paths converge, and the reasons for that convergence become clear, Haruki Murakami enfolds readers in 
                a world where cats talk, fish fall from the sky, and spirits slip out of their bodies to make love or commit 
                murder. <em>Kafka on the Shore</em> displays one of the worldâ€™s great storytellers at the peak of his powers.</p>
