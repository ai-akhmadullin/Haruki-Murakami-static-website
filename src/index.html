                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>Murakami was born in <em>Kyoto</em>, Japan, during the post-World War II baby boom and raised in <em>Nishinomiya</em>, 
                <em>Ashiya</em> and <em>Kobe</em>. He is an only child. His father was the son of a Buddhist priest, and his mother is 
                the daughter of an Osaka merchant. Both taught Japanese literature.</p>
                <p>His father was involved in the <em>Second Sino-Japanese War</em>, and was deeply traumatized by it, which would, 
                in turn, affect Murakami.</p> 
                <p>Since childhood, Murakami has been heavily influenced by Western culture, particularly Western as well as 
                Russian music and literature. He grew up reading a wide 
                range of works by European and American writers, such as <em>Franz Kafka</em>, <em>Gustave Flaubert</em>, <em>Charles Dickens</em>, 
                <em>Kurt Vonnegut</em>, <em>Fyodor Dostoyevsky</em>, <em>Richard Brautigan</em> and <em>Jack Kerouac</em>. These Western influences distinguish 
                Murakami from the majority of other Japanese writers.</p> 
                <p>Murakami studied drama at <em>Waseda University</em> in Tokyo, 
                where he met Yoko, now his wife. His first job was at a record store. Shortly before finishing his studies, 
                Murakami opened a coffee house and jazz bar, Peter Cat, in <em>Kokubunji</em>, Tokyo, which he ran with his wife, 
                from 1974 to 1981.</p>

            <p>Haruki Murakami is an incredible writer, whose popularity has grown all over the world. Surprisingly, 
                but he can be both comprehensible and incomprehensible, because he has quite an extensive author's baggage, 
                each story carries its own theme and its own characters. If you are just going to get acquainted with the work 
                of Haruki Murakami, we recommend the following order of reading his books:</p>
